# ZipCodeLookup Module

## Description

This module uses an internal class to perform Zip Code lookups against the USPS (United States Postal Service) web service. Passing in a Zip Code will return the city and state the Zip Code is associated with.

Note, for this to work you will need your own User ID for the USPS Web Service. It's free, see the [ReadMe](./../README.md) document in the root for more information on how to get your own ID.

## ZipCodeLookup Cmdlets

Gets Zip Code data for one or more zip codes passed in via the pipeline or a parameter.

### [New-ZipCodeLookup](New-ZipCodeLookup.md)
